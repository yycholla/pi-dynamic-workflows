   * Lifecycle contract for `runs`:
   *
   *  - An entry is added when a run starts (startInBackground/runSync) or is
   *    resumed (resume()), always with a live AbortController and (usually)
   *    an active RunLease.
   *  - While status is "running" or "paused", the entry is NEVER evicted —
   *    its execution could still settle (a pending executeRun() promise) or
   *    it is mid-usage-limit-checkpoint/manually-paused and still considered
   *    "the current state of this run" by callers. Eviction only ever
   *    considers an entry AFTER executeRun() has fully settled it to
   *    "completed" | "failed" | "aborted" (see IN_MEMORY_TERMINAL_STATUSES)
   *    and persisted + released its lease — i.e. strictly after the same
   *    isCurrent()-gated persistRun()/releaseRunLease() calls in
   *    executeRun()'s success/catch tails.
   *  - Once terminal, an entry becomes eviction-ELIGIBLE (recordTerminalRun())
   *    but is not necessarily evicted immediately: up to
   *    maxTerminalRunsInMemory terminal entries are kept, oldest evicted
   *    first, so a `getRun()` call immediately after completion (e.g. the
   *    "complete" event's own synchronous listeners — task-panel's result
   *    delivery, `/workflows watch`) still sees the live object. Once
   *    evicted, the entry is simply removed from `runs`; nothing else reads
   *    or writes it again.
   *  - Every caller of getRun()/getSnapshot() must treat "undefined"/null as
   *    "no live in-memory copy right now" and fall back to listRuns() (backed
   *    by run-persistence.ts, which is what's authoritative for a run once
   *    the in-memory copy is gone) — this mirrors how those callers already
   *    treat any run this process never had in memory (e.g. one started by a
   *    different process and only ever seen via listRuns()). resume() never
   *    depends on `runs` for a run's state either: it always reloads from
   *    persistence, so an evicted runId resumes exactly like one from a
   *    prior process.
   *  - isCurrent(managed) composes with eviction the same way it composes
   *    with resume()/deleteRun() replacing or removing an entry: eviction
   *    removes the map entry outright, so a stale execution's later settle
   *    (isCurrent() check) sees `this.runs.get(runId) !== managed` (in fact
   *    undefined) and correctly no-ops, exactly as it would after
   *    resume()/deleteRun().
