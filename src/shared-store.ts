/**
 * In-memory key-value store scoped to a single workflow run.
 *
 * One `SharedStore` instance is created at run start and disposed when the run
 * ends. Two MCP-compatible tool definitions (`store_put` / `store_get`) are
 * injected into every agent's tool list so parallel agents can share
 * intermediate state without coordinating through the script itself.
 *
 * Journal integration: callers capture `store.commitDelta(deltaKey)` alongside
 * each agent result in the journal. On resume, `store.applyDelta(delta)` rebuilds
 * the store state additively in callSeq order, so parallel-agent writes are
 * replayed correctly without the last-complete-wins ordering bug that a
 * whole-Map restore() would cause.
 *
 * `deltaKey` must be unique across every run that shares this store instance,
 * not just within one run's callSeq. A nested `workflow()` call restarts its own
 * callSeq at 0 while inheriting the parent's store (so parent and nested-run
 * agents can share state), so a bare callIndex would collide between a parent
 * agent and a concurrently-running nested-run agent that both got index 0 —
 * whichever commits its delta last would clobber the other's entry in
 * `agentDeltas`. Callers compose `deltaKey` as `${runId}:${callIndex}`, and
 * since every run (including each nested run) gets its own distinct `runId`,
 * the composite key is unique across the whole store's lifetime.
